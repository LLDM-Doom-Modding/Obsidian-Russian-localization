Addons must be either .zip archives or subfolders within this folder.

The structure of your addon should mimic that of the base folder of the program, 
for example if you want to add a new module and were using folders:

(Obsidian folder)
  |
addons
  |
addon name
  |
modules
  |
your_cool_module.lua

For zips, you would want the modules "folder" to be at the root of the archive, and
name the zip itself whatever you'd like your addon to be called.
